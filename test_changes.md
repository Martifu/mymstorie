# Testing Changes for MediaCarousel and EntryDetailModal

## Changes Made:

### MediaCarousel Component:
1. ✅ Removed BasicVideoPlayer import
2. ✅ Added filtering to only show images: `const imageMedia = media?.filter(item => item.type === 'image') || [];`
3. ✅ Updated all references to use `imageMedia` instead of `media`
4. ✅ Component returns null if no images are available
5. ✅ Updated ImageViewer to receive filtered images

### EntryDetailModal Component:
1. ✅ Removed MediaCarousel import
2. ✅ Added BasicVideoPlayer and ImageViewer imports
3. ✅ Redesigned layout with title at top
4. ✅ Added two-column grid for media (images and videos)
5. ✅ Added image viewer functionality for grid images
6. ✅ Videos now play directly in the grid using BasicVideoPlayer
7. ✅ Floating vinyl player remains unchanged

### FeedPost Component:
1. ✅ Updated media counter to correctly show image count and video count

## Test Cases to Verify:

1. **Entry with only images**: 
   - MediaCarousel should show images in carousel
   - Detail view should show images in grid
   - Image viewer should work when clicking images

2. **Entry with only videos**:
   - MediaCarousel should not show (return null)
   - Detail view should show videos in grid
   - Videos should be playable in grid

3. **Entry with mixed media**:
   - MediaCarousel should show only images
   - Detail view should show both images and videos in grid
   - Feed should show correct count (e.g., "3 fotos + 2 videos")

4. **Entry with no media**:
   - MediaCarousel should not show
   - Detail view should not show media grid

All components should compile without errors and maintain existing functionality while implementing the new design requirements.
